# SneakerCrypt
Sneakercrypt is an open-source implementation of the theoretically secure [one-time pad encryption scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). The goal of Sneakercrypt is to assist users in generating, sharing, and communicating with one-time-pads.

##  One-Time Pad (OTP) Cryptography
A random stream of bits, known as a "pad", is generated by two parties who wish to communicate. The parties meet in person and exchange the pads. Messages are encrypted by performing an XOR operation with pad to produce an encrypted *ciphertext*:

	message    : 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
	pad        : 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
	ciphertext : 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1

The XOR operation produces a 1 if the bits differ (a 0 and a 1), and a 0 if the bits are the same (both 0 or 1). To decrypt, the receiving party performs an xor between the ciphertext and the pad to recover the original message (the *plaintext*):

	ciphertext : 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
	pad        : 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
	plaintext  : 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0

After the message is decrypted by the receiving party, Sneakercrypt erases the bits from the pad, preventing parties that have intercepted the ciphertext from decrypting the message if the pad is stolen. One-time pad cryptography is invulnerable to "cipher-text only attacks", and provides **complete** communication security, as long as two (admittedly nontrivial) conditions are met:

1. The generated pads are truly random.
2. The pads are kept secret.

## Motivation
Public-key encryption exists and protects the internet. Why does the world need Sneakercrypt? After all, since Sneakercrypt doesn't rely on fancy mathematics, parties wishing to securely communicate must meet in person to exchange keys, a highly inconvenient task. The answer is that one-time pads can help two parties communicate when other forms of encryption fall short. Public-key encryption is [mathematically complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29#Key_generation), and [implementations are prone to bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed). Sneakercrypt is a relatively small package, making bugs quite shallow and easy to detect. In addition, while public-key encryption algorithms are rely on computationally intractible problems, there is some evidence to suggest that an adversary with a quantum computer can solve these problems. For some, Sneakercrypt may be the **only** reliable option.
